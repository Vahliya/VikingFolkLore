        <h1>Phishing</h1>
        <p>Phishing is the crime of deceiving people into sharing sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers. As with real fishing, there's more than one way to reel in a victim, but one phishing tactic is the most common. Victims receive a malicious email (malspam) or a text message that imitates (or “spoofs”) a person or organization they trust, like a coworker, a bank, or a government office. When the victim opens the email or text, they find a scary message meant to overcome their better judgement by filling them with fear. The message demands that the victim go to a website and take immediate action or risk some sort of consequence.</p>

        <p>If users take the bait and click the link, they're sent to an imitation of a legitimate website. From here, they're asked to log in with their username and password credentials. If they are gullible enough to comply, the sign-on information goes to the attacker, who uses it to steal identities, pilfer bank accounts, and sell personal information on the black market.</p>

        <p>Recognizing a phishing attempt isn't always easy, but a few tips, a little discipline, and some common sense will go a long way. Look for something that's off or unusual, such as:</p>

        <li>The email makes an offer that sounds too good to be true.</li>
        <li>You recognize the sender, but it's someone you don't talk to, or it's a topic that you wouldn't talk about or share.</li>
        <li>The email has charged or alarmist language to create a sense of urgency, exhorting you to click and “act now”.</li>
        <li>The message contains unexpected or unusual attachments.</li>
        <li>The message contains links that look a little off, misspellings or a different URL than usual or suggested</li>
