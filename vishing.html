        <h1>Vishing</h1>
        <p>Voice phishing is a form of criminal phone fraud, using social engineering over the telephone system to gain access to private personal and financial information for the purpose of financial reward. It is sometimes referred to as 'vishing' - a portmanteau of "voice" and phishing.</p>
        <p>Some of the main types of vishing phone calls to be aware of are:</p>
        <li>Unwanted ech support/computer repair</li>
        <li>Charities requesting financial information</li>
        <li>Survey calls</li>
        <li>Banks claiming reward, wrongdoing on your part, or requresting your account details</li>
        <li>Institutions of authority, such as the police or the HMRC, claiming wrongdoing on your part and requesting money.</li>
        <li>One-ring scams where the phone rings once in order to intice victims into calling them back in order to be charged hefty call fees.</li>

        <p>No companies, financial institutions, and institutions of authority will request your details out of the blue, especially financial information or information required to access your accounts with them.</p>

        <p>The best bet is to hang up immediately, and to avoid accepting or calling unknown or sucpicious numbers. Try searching the number online on services such as <a href="https://who-called.co.uk">Who Called Me?</a></p>
