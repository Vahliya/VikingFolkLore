        <h1>Spyware</h1>
        <p>Spyware is a generic term for malicious software that infects your PC or mobile device and gathers information about you, your browsing and Internet usage habits, as well as other data.</p>

        <p>Spyware is sneaky, usually finding its way onto your computer without your knowledge or permission, attaching itself to your operating system, maintaining a presence on your PC. You might have even inadvertently given permission for the spyware to install itself when you agree to the terms and conditions of a seemingly legitimate program you downloaded without reading the fine print.</p>

        <p>Spyware runs quietly in the background, collecting information or monitoring your activities in order to trigger malicious activities related to your computer and how you use it. That includes capturing keystrokes, screen shots, authentication credentials, personal email addresses, web form data, Internet usage information, and other personal information, such as credit card numbers.</p>
